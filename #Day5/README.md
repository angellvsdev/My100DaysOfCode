# ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
Today, as i'm working and learning with the **SOLID principles**, i've decided to practice the next pilar, the Open/Closed principle, this principle stipulates that every code should be opened for his extension, but closed to his modification, under this concept, i think how to apply this concept without copy nothing from StackOverFlow (lol), i mean, create my own problem, and apply the OCP correctly, then, in my problem, we need to sort arrays in certain order, this sort is maded by a method in a class, but this method can't be modified, so, i created a class for each sorting style, this way, i just gotta create new classes and adapt them to the father class method.

# ðŸ“‹ What i've learned from this?
The **Open/Closed principle** use, particularly, i find this principle so useful (yeah yeah, all the principles at **SOLID** are useful), but particularly, i love this principle, i feel like i can code fastest and get less headaches in the future, then i will be practicing this (as the other principles as well) too much! See you in a next update! â˜•
