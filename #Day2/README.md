 # ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
Today i completed the second part of this first round of coding creating classes, instantiating, changing methods, and others things, in this occasion, i will create a new class called "BancaryAccount", with this class, i will stock two attributes, the headline of this account, and the balance (that could be in floating numbers), and the requirements are this:
- Setters & getters
- A `show()` to show the account details.
- A `deposit()` method to deposit money, if the quantity comes in negative numbers, the method will do nothing.
- A `withdraw()` method. The account balance could be in red numbers.

The final result was the expected and took me around of 1.5 hours get this done, this time i made something that i didn't realize i could did at the moment i was programming, and that was the entries validations directly in the constructor, and yes, i've could programmed a function with the validation and use it the times i needed, but for some reason, when i tried to shoot the function at the constructor it drop me an error, so i decided to repeat that validation certain times across the class methods due to without can do the validations in the constructor creating a separate function to recycle that piece of code was no longer making sense to me. So i did it this way.
