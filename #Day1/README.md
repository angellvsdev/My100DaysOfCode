 # ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
 Today i decided to practice my skills with the basics of the POO to start all my path trought the Programming Paradigms correctly, i decided to work in a little excercise where i create a class with his setters, getters, attributes, special methods and of course, i build an instance of this class for testing. This was the requirements of the excercise:
 Build a class called "Person", his attributs will be; name, age, dni. Build the following methods for this class: 
- His constructor
- Setters & Getters for each attribute (Validate entries)
- A `show()` method to show client data
- A `isAdult()` metrhod to return a logic value to indicate if is an adult or not

The final result was the expectated, and took me around of 1 hour to get this done. It could be improved, maybe refactorize some validations from the methods in a single method, but i did not realize it untill the second excercise of this round (excercise that i did in the second day).

# â˜• What i've learned from this?
I created and instanced a class with the basics, learned how to use correctly getters and setters in JS (due to the strange behaviors of JavaScript in certain details) and not too much, it's a soft start, and i'm just warming up for what i'll be doing the next days.
