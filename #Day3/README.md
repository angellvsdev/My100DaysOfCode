 # ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
This time all was pretty slow, and i'm not so happy, this was bored and so easy, and even not took me an hour to code this, but i just extended the class features to another class, in this time, i just created a class specially for young users, where the class now will comes with a bonification attribute represented in percentage and a numeric attribute to represent the age, and a little method to know if the user is between the 18-25 years old, and if user is not in the correct age range, he could not withdraw money from the account

# â˜• What i've learned from this?
I'm pretty frustrated this time lol, i did not learned nothing, i just put in practice the class extending so... I hope this will be the only boring day in this #100DaysOfCode challenge.
