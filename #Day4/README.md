# üìã What i did today?
All right, a very long time since my last upload, i lose the time notion so easy, and almost a month without follow correctly the challenge (oof) i've been studying about the SOLID principles and i decided to test my knowledge about them
creating a little excercise where i test the first principle, the **Single Resposibility Principle**, from now, i will follow the challenge correctly and will not stop, so, stay tune (bruh why am i writing this as if someone will read it, this repo is private).
Anyway, what i did is simulate a little Ebooks Application, where i need to store, create, and manipulate ebooks and it's content, to get this done, i've decided to create three classes, each class got a single responsibility, the first class handle the ebook
creation, the second class, manipulate and save inside itself the ebooks, and has the necessary methods to store and control the ebooks content, the third class, handle the ebooks storing, where according to the ebook category, each library has it's own slot
quantity and a array that saves this ebooks.

# üìã What i've learned from this?
The **Single Responsibility Principle** domination, i enjoyed practicing with this, and learned a better how to separate the classes responsibility and have a cleanest code, more robust and easy to scalate.
I'll be posting and practicing all the pilars of SOLID this days while i work on a project. Soooo, nothing! Thanks for reading. ‚ù§
